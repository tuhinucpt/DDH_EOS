## Relativistic description of dense matter equation of state and compatibility with neutron star observables: a Bayesian approach 

The general behavior of the nuclear equation of state (EOS), relevant for the description of neutron stars (NS), 
is studied within a  Bayesian approach applied to a set of models based on a density dependent relativistic mean 
field description of nuclear matter. The EOS is subjected to a  minimal number of constraints based on nuclear 
saturation properties and  the low density pure neutron matter EOS  obtained from a precise next-to-next-to-next-to-leading 
order (N$^{3}$LO) calculation in chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT). The number of final sample parameters 
corresponding to the posterior sets are around {fifteen thousand}. We present five EOSs among them, namely 
DDBl, DDBm, DDBu1, DDBu2 and DDBx. The DDBl, DDBm, DDBu2 were chosen so that the radius of the 1.4$M_\odot$ 
star has the lower limit, a medium value and the upper limit  of the the 90\% CI for the conditional 
probabilities $P(R|M)$. We have also included DDBu1 that has a slightly lower $R_{1.4}$ than the upper limit but
lies completely inside the 90\% CI for the conditional probabilities $P(R|M)$.

<!We also release our entire sets of 15K NS matter EOS. All the EOSs are for NS core and starting 
baryon density is 0.04 fm$^{-3}$. Once has to chose their own crust EOS for the calculation of star properties.
The uncertainty in star properties for the choice of different crust has been discussed in Section 2.1 of 
the manuscript (arxiv: 2201.12552).>
